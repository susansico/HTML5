            <p><span class="FirstWords">The Statue of Liberty</span>, maintained by the National Park Service &#40;NPS&#41;, is on Liberty Island in the middle of New York Harbor in Manhattan, New York City.  The statue, designed by Auguste Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Bartholdi and dedicated on October 28, 1886 with New York&#39;s first ticket tape parade, was a gift to the United States from the people of France.  The statue, with skin made of copper sheets supported by an iron truss tower, is of a robed female figure representing Libertas, the Roman goddess of freedom, who bears a torch and a tabula ansata &#40;a tablet evoking the law&#41; upon which is inscribed the date of the American Declaration of Independence, July 4th, 1776.  A broken chain and shackle lie at the statue&#39;s right foot.</p>

            <h3>Early History</h3>

            <p><span class="FirstWord">Fr&#233;d&#233;ric</span> Bartholdi was inspired by French law professor &#201;douard Ren&#233; de Laboulaye, a politician, <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Constitution expert, and abolitionist,
            who is said to have commented in 1865 that any monument raised to American independence would properly be a joint project of the French and American people. In 1870, when Barthholdi made a first model of his concept of the Statue of Liberty, he was also planning a trip to the United States.  He and Laboulaye decided the time would be right during the trip to discuss the idea of the joint project with influential Americans.</p>

                <p>Bartholdi was inspired by French law professor &#201;douard Ren&#233; de Laboulaye.</p>

                <p class="ReadMore">Read the book review of
                <cite><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Liberty-s-Torch-by-Elizabeth-Mitchell-5596849.php">
                &#8216;Liberty&#39;s Torch&#8217;</a></cite>, by Elizabeth Mitchell.  "She deems it unlikely that Édouard
                Laboulaye, the French poet and politician, encouraged the young Bartholdi&#8230;".</p>

            </aside>

            <p><span class="FirstWord">In</span> June 1871, Bartholdi crossed the Atlantic with letters of introduction signed by Laboulaye.  Arriving at New York Harbor, Bartholdi focused on Bedloe&#39;s Island as a site for the statue because vessels arriving in New York had to sail pass the island and it was owned by the United States government. The island had been ceded by the New York State Legislature to the federal government in 1800 for harbor defense.  Bartholdi crossed the United States twice by rail, discussing the project with many Americans.  Upon his return to France, he continued to develop the concept of the statue.</p>

            <p><span class="FirstWord">In</span> September 1875, Laboulaye announced the project and the formation of the Franco American Union as its fund&#45;raising arm.  With the announcement, the statue was given a name, Liberty   prPREnlightening the World.  The French would finance the statue and the Americans would be expected to pay for the pedestal.</p>

            <p><span class="FirstWord">In</span> 1876, under Bartholdi's direction, French artisans and craftsmen began
            constructing the right arm bearing the torch and the head of the statue.  The work was done at the Gaget, Gauthier
            &#38; Co. workshop.  In May of 1876, Bartholdi traveled to the United States as a member of a French delegation to
            the Centennial Exhibition.  The arm bearing the torch arrived in Philadelphia in August of 1876 and was shown at the
            exhibition.  After the exhibition closed, the arm was transported to New York, where it remained on display in
            Madison Square Park for several years before it was returned to France to join the rest of the statue.</p>

            <aside class="AsideRightFloatAndMargin Aside" role="complementary">

                <p>Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Bartholdi designed the broken shackle and chain that lie at the Statue&#39;s right foot
                as a representation of the abolition of slavery.  Today, with institutionalized racism, this is not a powerful
                image for African Americans.</p>

            <p><span class="FirstWord">On</span>
            his return to Paris in 1877, Bartholdi concentrated on completing the head, which was exhibited at the 1878 Paris
            World&#39;s Fair.  By 1882, the statue was complete up to the waist, an event Bartholdi celebrated by inviting
            reporters to lunch on a platform built within the statue.   In July 4, 1884, the completed statue was formally
            presented to Ambassador Morton at a ceremony in Paris.  By 1885 the United States had made sufficient progress on the
            pedestal so that the statue could be disassembled and crated for its ocean voyage to the

                <!-- Naming of Eastern End of Long Island Aside -->
                <p>The prominent bluff at the eastern end of Long Island reminded the first European settlers of a turtle’s back,
                and was thus named Turtle Hill. The point’s current name, Montauk Point, refers to the Montauket Indians, who
                were part of a confederation of four local tribes that also included the Cutchoges, the Shinnecocks, and the
                Manhassets.</p>

            <p><span class="FirstWords">The Montauk Point Light</span>,the official name of the Montauk Point Lighthouse, is
            maintained by the Montauk Historical Society.  It is located in Montauk Point State Park on Turtle Hill at the
            easternmost point of Long Island at 2000 Montauk Highway, in the hamlet of Montauk in the Town of East Hampton in
            Suffolk County, New York, overlooking the Atlantic Ocean.  The lighthouse was the first to be built within the state
            of New York and was the first public works project of the new United States. It is the fourth oldest active
            lighthouse in the United States, still serving as an active aid to navigation.  Its tower is 110 feet 6 inches high
            and the current light, installed in July 2001, is equivalent to approximately 290,000 candle power, flashes every 5
            seconds, and can be seen at a distance of 17 nautical miles (31 km).  In 2012, the Montauk Point Light was designated
            a National Historic Landmark for its significance to New York and international shipping in the early Federal
            period.

            <h3>History</h3>

            <p><span class="FirstWord">Construction</span> on the lighthouse was authorized by the Second United States Congress,
            under President George Washington on April 12, 1792.  Erza L&#39;Hommedieu, a prominent lawyer, member of the
            Continental Congress, and a man with Scientific interests, consulted with Washington on its construction.  He
            represented the New York City Chamber of Commerce related to the lighthouse.  He made the case that New York City was
            the first among American ports in the volume of its foreign commerce.  Its harbor was handling almost a third of the
            nation&#39;s trade with other countries. Due to the prevailing winds in winter, shippers approaching from sea needed
            a lighthouse at the end of Long Island to guide them along the south side of New York harbor.  The project was begun
            on June 7, 1796, and was completed on November 5, 1796.  Sometime in early April 1797, Keeper Jacob Hand lit the
            wicks in the lamps of the tower and the lighthouse began operation.  It continued under civilian keepers until World
            War &#8545;.</p>

            <!-- New York contractor named John McComb Aside -->
            <aside class="AsideLeftFloatAndMargin Aside" role="complementary">

                <p>A New York contractor named John McComb submitted the low bid of &#36;22,300 for constructing the Montauk
                Point Light, beating out three other contractors. After assembling a fifty-man crew consisting of masons,
                carpenters, blacksmiths, and bricklayers, McComb built the lighthouse like a fortress, with a foundation that
                went down thirteen feet and a base with walls seven feet thick.</p>

            </aside>

            <p><span class="FirstWord">During</span>
            World War &#8545;, the lighthouse was taken over by the United States Army as part of the Eastern Coastal
            Defense Shield.  The last civilian keepers departed in the spring of 1943.  Adjacent to the lighthouse, camp Hero was
            opened by the Army in 1942 and was heavily fortified with huge guns during the war.  The gun emplacements are still
            visible.
            </p>

            <p><span class="FirstWord">In</span>
            1946 the United States Coast Guard took over maintenance of the lighthouse and operated it until the station
            was automated on February 3, 1987.  In May of that year, the lighthouse museum opened to the public, operated by the
            Montauk Historical Society.  It leased the property from the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Coast Guard for
            the purpose of the museum.  On September 30, 1996, President Bill Clinton signed legislation transferring the
            lighthouse property to the Montauk Historical Society.</p>

            </figure>

            <p><span class="FirstWord">When</span>
            the lighthouse tower was build on Turtle Hill, it was 300 feet from the edge of the cliff.  Over the past 200 years,
            approximately 200 feet was washed into the Atlantic Ocean which means the tower is now 100 feet from the Cliff.
            After World War &#8545;, the United States Army Corp of Engineers build a seawall at its base, but the erosion
            continued.  In the 1980&#39;s, Giorgina Reid &#40;1908-2001&#41;, a textile designer, had saved her Rocky Point, New
            York cottage from collapse by building a simple set of terraces in the gullies of the bluff.  She proposed the
            Reed&#45;Trench Terracing solution to the Montauk Historical Society.  Reed&#45;Trench Terracing, which consisted of
            building terrace platforms made of various beach debris, notably reeds, along with further strengthening of the rocks
            at the bluff toe, did stem the erosion.  The Erosion Control Project of Montauk Point was successfully completed in
            1998 with support from various sources, including the Montauk Historical Society and the State of New York.</p>

            <p><span class="FirstWord">Even</span>
            with the completion of the Erosion Control Project, erosion of the seawall is still occurring.  In November
            2006, the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Army Corps of Engineers&#39; plan to build another seawall was
            opposed by a local surfing group, who contended that a seawall would ruin the nearby world-renowned surf break.  The
            surfing group continues to oppose the seawall.</p>

            carving a mountain.  Borglum took Robinson up on his offer and met with him in September of 1924 and August of 1925.
            Robinson&#39;s initial idea was to sculpt the Needles, a region of eroded granite pillars, towers, and spires in the
            Black Hills.  Gutzon Borlum rejected the Needles because of the poor quality of the granite and strong opposition
            from Native American groups.  They settled on the Mount Rushmore Location, which also had the advantage of facing
            southeast for maximum sun exposure.  Robinson wanted it to feature western heroes like Lewis and Clark, Red Cloud,
            and Buffalo Bill Cody, but Borglum decided the sculpture should have a more national focus and chose the four
            presidents whose likenesses would be carved into the mountain.</p>

            October 4, 1927, Gutzon Borglum and 400 workers started sculpting the 60&#45;foot carvings of the Presidents on
            Mount Rushmore under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service. Borglum selected Washington, Jefferson,
            Roosevelt, and Lincoln to sculpt because of their role in preserving the Republic and expanding its territory.</p>

            <p><span class="FirstWord">The</span>
            400 workers. who were usually miners, sculptors, or rock climbers, used dynamite, jackhammering, and chiseling
            to sculpt the model from the mountain.  A stairway was constructed to the top of the mountain first and ropes fixed.
            The workers had to endure conditions that varied from blazing hot to bitter cold and windy.  Each day they climbed
            700 stairs to the top of the mountain to punch&#45;in on the time clock.  Then 3&#47;8 inch thick steel cables
            lowered them over the front of the 500&#45;foot face of the mountain in a bosun chair.  The workers were then
            supported by harnesses attached to ropes as they did the sculpting.

            efficiency and working conditions of the project.  Spotts had the tram upgraded so it could reach the top of Mount
            Rushmore for the ease of the workers.  Gutzon Borglum didn&#39;t want outside control over his projects and
            successfully returned control to an appointed commission, mostly of his choosing, in 1938.  Borglum then started
            construction of a large repository, called the Hall of Records, in a valley behind the sculpture, that was intended
            to tell the story of Mount Rushmore and of the United States.  After Congress threatened to cut off all funding for
            the project unless the funding was used to specifically finish the sculpture itself, Borglum stopped work on the hall
            in 1939 and it was never finished. </p>

            Rushmore, known to the Lakota Sioux as Six Grandfathers, is controversial among Native Americans
            because the United States seized the area from the Lakota tribe after the Great Sioux War of 1876.  The Treaty of
            Fort Laramie from 1868 had previously granted the Black Hills to the Lakota in perpetuity.  In 2004, the first native

            <p><span class="FirstWords">The Savannah Historic District</span> was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1966.
            It is significant for its distinctive town plan as well as its 18th and 19th century architecture.  The district,
            which falls within an area of less than one half square mile, encompasses the original town plan laid out in 1733 by
            General James E. Oglethorpe, founder of the British colony of Georgia.  Today Savannah retains much of this plan
            based on units called wards which contain blocks arrayed around squares.  Of the original 24 squares, there are now
            22 squares &#8211; three squares were demolished and then one of the three was reclaimed &#8211; surrounded by
            examples of buildings in the Georgian, Greek Revival, and Gothic styles.</p>

            <h3>History</h3>

            <p><span class="FirstWord">James</span>
            Edward Oglethorpe founded the town of Savannah in February 11, 1733 situated on a forty&#45;foot&#45;high
            bluff overlooking a river, eighteen miles from the Atlantic. His plan for settlement of the new colony had been in
            the works since 1730, three years before the founding of Savannah.  The plan was an embodiment of all the major
            themes of the Enlightenment, including science, humanism, and secular government.  Oglethorpe&#39;s comprehensive and
            multi&#45;faceted plan had a vision of social equity and allocation.  The mechanisms supporting that vision,
            including yeoman governance, equitable land allocation, stable land tenure, prohibition of slavery, and secular
            administration, were among the ideas debated during the British Enlightenment.</p>

            <p><span class="FirstWord">In</span>
            following his plan, James Oglethorpe originally laid out four squares in 1733 &#8211; Johnson, Wright, Ellis, and
            Telfair.  The basic design unit of the plan was the ward which was composed of four tything &#40;residential&#41;
            blocks and four trust &#40;civic&#41; blocks arrayed around a central square.  Because Oglethorpe's plan allowed for
            the growth of Savannah, city officials were able to add additional squares during the 18th and 19th centuries.  By
            1851 there were 24 squares in the city, each approximately one acre in size and laid out in general accordance with
            the original design, filling most of the original square mile town common.</p>

                <a href="http://aap.cornell.edu/people/john-reps">John Reps</a>, <q>Savannah&#8230; used the power gained

            <p><span class="FirstWord">The</span>
            streets bounding the wards allowed uninterrupted movement of traffic.  Internal streets were interrupted by
            the squares to create a pedestrian&#45;friendly scale.  The resulting pattern featured eight blocks to a ward.  The
            four larger blocks on the north and south sides of the square, the tything blocks, were further divided by
            east&#45;west lanes.  Four smaller blocks, the trust blocks, fronted the squares on the east and west.  The tything
            blocks contained ten houses which were the basic organizational unit for administration, farming, and defense.  Each
            tything was assigned a square mile tract outside town for farming, with each family farming a 45&#45;acre plot within
            that tract.</p>

            <p><span class="FirstWord">Savannah's</span>
            squares formed a public outdoor extension of the restricted living space of narrow urban lots.  Many
            of the squares were adorned by monuments, markers, memorials, statues, plaques, and other tributes commemorating
            various aspects of the city&#39;s history.  Most of the squares were named in honor or in memory of a person,
            persons, or historical event, and wards often shared the name of the square.</p>

            1820&#39;s witnessed a proliferation of federal style brick townhouses with a sidehall plan, both paired and in
            rows.  Renowned English architect William Jay designed several high style Regency residences during this period which
            are distinguished by symmetry and innovative interior effects.  Examples of the Regency style include the
            Ownens&#45;Thomas House &#40;1818&#41; and the Scarbrough House.  Greek revival, the predominant architectural style
            in the Savannah Historical District, began its reign in the 1830s. Constructed from Savannah grey brick, these
            residences are defined by a raised basement, side hall, simple lintel above the door and windows, transom lights, and
            classical elements such as Doric or Ionic columns and dentils.  Greek Revival design was also applied to many
            institutional buildings such as Christ Church &#40;1838&#41; and the United States Customs House
            &#40;1848&#45;1852&#41;.  After 1850, Savannah saw the rise of Italianate, Queen Anne, and Gothic and exotic revival
            styles.  The Greene House &#40;1853&#41; is an example of Gothic revival design.</p>

            official contract service in September 1858 with the stagecoach service transporting passengers, freight, and letters
            in a trip that took about 25 days.  The Butterfield route stretched from almost 2,800 miles between San Francisco in
            the west, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis and Memphis in the east.  A southern route through Fort Yuma and
            El Paso was chosen for the mail service as it would remain snow free during the winter.  Besides serving as mail
            service, the Butterfield Overland Mail route also served as a main road between California and the East before the
            completion of the transcontinental railroads.</p>

            <h3>Butterfield Overland Mail Stage Stations</h3>

            <p><span class="FirstWord">Originally</span>
            there were 53 stations in California, where horse teams could be watered and exchanged for fresh
            horses, but later 6 more were added to fill in some of the larger gaps.  The stations were located 8 miles to 32
            miles apart.  The total length of the route across the state was approximately 742 miles.  California was divided
            into two administrative stage station divisions, the First and the Second.  There were 34 stations in the First
            Division and nineteen stations in the Second Division.  The Oak Grove Butterfield Stage Station was in the Second
            Division.</p>

            <p><span class="FirstWord">The</span> Second Division&#39;s route from Fort Yuma to Warner&#39;s Pass followed the
            Sonora Road, an old Spanish trail from Sonora, Mexico, to San Diego.  It connected Los Angeles with Fort Yuma at the
            Colorado River. Los Angeles was the route&#39;s terminus and the headquarters of the Second Division.  The
            headquarters was located in a brick building at the Pueblo de Los Angeles, consisting of an office, blacksmith s hop,
            stables, and sheds.  Traveling between Los Angeles and Fort Yuma used a route that was 282 miles long and took 72
            hours to complete. The Oak Grove Butterfield Stage Station was located 10 miles north of the Warner&#39;s ranch
            station, and 12 miles south of the Tejungo station.  It was a swing station where horses and mail were exchanged,
            but not a meal stop.</p>

            <h3>End of Butterfield Overland Mail Stagecoach Line</h3>

            <p><span class="FirstWord">After</span> John Butterfield fell into debt, the Butterfield Overland Mail stagecoach line was owned by Wells Fargo, which eventually lost its contract when it appeared that civil war was impending, since much of the ButterfieldOverland Mail route traveled through the Southern states.  The contract was canceled on March 2, 1861 with the end ofservice on June 30, 1861.  During the Civil War, the building was used as a hospital for nearby Camp Wright.  Afterthe war, the adobe changed hands several times, becoming a tavern, hotel, post office, even adding gas pumps, and eing a grocery store.  In the 1990s, the building was filled with antiques and served as a private museum.</p>
